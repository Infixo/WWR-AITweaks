# Worldwide Rush Infixo's AI Tweaks
[Worldwide Rush](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325500/Worldwide_Rush/) mod that adds some AI enhancements to the game.

## Features

### Maintain routes
Currently only one feature is implemented - better logic for evaluating and maintaining lines for the Hub Manager's Maintain mode.
- The line is evaluated for the last 2 months and based on efficiency, throughput and vehicles' capacities, optimal range is determined.
- Optimal range is betwen 1/3 and 2/3 of minimum efficiency and full (100%) efficiency, where minimum efficiency is required for the line to be profitable at all.
- Number of waiting passengers and average trip trime are also taken into consideration.
- Based on the above, the manager decides if the line should be upgraded or downgraded and/or if more/less vehicles are needed.
- (0.2) All vehicle manipulations go thorugh Generated Plan which assures that a vehicle is not sold when the replacement is not possible.
- (0.2) Balanced line growth - manager will try for all vehicles be of similar tier.
- (0.2) Optimal number of vehicles accounts for trip time and type of vehicles.
- (0.2) Evaluation results can be displayed as a tooltip by UITweaks.
- IMPORTANT NOTES.
  - The process of upgrading/downgrading involves first selling the old one, and after that buying a new one. This logic also exists in the vanilla gamem btw. It is imperative to make sure the hub manager has enough funds to acquire a new vehicle. Otherwise, you may end up with an empty line. I recommend using Budget setting and set it to the value that allows to buy the best vehicle currently available.
  - Only evaluation core and decision logic is changed, other supporting routines (e.g. selecting a better or worse vehicle) are still vanilla verions.
